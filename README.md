## üìÇ Features

- **Version Comparison**: Compares package versions in your `requirements.txt` with the installed versions.
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Displays packages that are "Up to date" in the default color.
  - Highlights packages with a "Different version" in yellow.
  - Highlights missing or uninstalled packages in red.
- **Automatic Update**: Optionally update your `requirements.txt` to reflect the installed package versions.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1. Ensure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PoyBoi/requirementsHelper
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd requirementsHelper
   ```

## üîß Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python requirementsHelper.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a path to a `requirements.txt` file or a directory containing one or more requirements.txt files. The tool will then:
- Compare the versions specified in the file with the versions installed in your environment.
- Display the comparison in a formatted table with color-coded statuses.
- Prompt you to update the requirements.txt file if discrepancies are found.
