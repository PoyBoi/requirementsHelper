## üìÇ Features

- **Version Comparison**: Compares package versions in your `requirements.txt` with the installed versions.
- **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Packages that are up to date appear in the `default color`, packages with different versions are highlighted in `yellow`, and missing or uninstalled packages are shown in `red`.
- **Automatic Update**: Optionally update your `requirements.txt` to reflect the installed package versions.

Using requirements file: /path/to/your/project/requirements.txt
